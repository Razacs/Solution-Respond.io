# Solution-Respond.io
This repo has QA solution of Respond.io, I have mentioned detail execution in pdf file as well.

Task 01 Solve:
--------------

For UI Automation, I have used Selenium Maven with BDD and Page object model framework reusability and redundancy. Also I have used Page Factory technique. It is used for initialization of Page objects or to instantiate the Page object itself.

Folder Structure:
-----------------
Page Facory Folder Have all the Page classes StepDefinition Folder  Have all the Step Definition classes Feature Folder Have all the features

Target folder have the HTML report and .json report for passed / failed test cases

How to execute:
---------------
There are two ways to execute, 1) Run .feature file. 2) Run the Test Runner file, it will generate test cases report in .html and .json format.  For reporting I have used Junit reports.

Task Solution 02:
----------------
I have used Cypress tool for API automation task. Api-crud.cy.js  file describe all the test cases in it. Fixture file have all the test data with key value pair.

Execution of test:
-------------------
On terminal write command npm run test. Then execute the test case.
